## Overview

The Automatic Room Light Control System is a semester 4 individual project aimed at improving energy efficiency and convenience by enhancing an existing motion sensor light with remote control capabilities. This innovative solution combines motion detection and darkness sensing to automatically control room lighting, reducing unnecessary energy consumption.

## Functionality

This product offers two distinct operation modes:

1. **Automatic Mode**: In this mode, the system intelligently monitors the room's darkness and detects motion. It turns on the lights when a person enters a dark room and turns them off when the room is unoccupied or sufficiently lit, promoting energy conservation.

2. **Manual Mode**: Users can take control of the lighting using a remote control, allowing them to toggle the lights as needed.

## Features

- **Energy-Efficient**: Optimizes energy consumption by automatically controlling lighting based on occupancy and darkness.
- **Remote Control**: Provides the convenience of manual control using a remote.
- **Eco-Friendly**: Contributes to a greener future by reducing carbon footprint.
- **Cost-Effective**: Helps cut electricity bills through responsible energy management.

## Product Selection

To start this project, I researched and selected an existing motion sensor light as the foundation for my innovation.

## Extra Features

To enhance the product, I brainstormed extra features and decided to implement remote control functionality, making it more user-friendly and versatile.

### PCB Schematic

My PCB design consists of three main parts:

1. **Sensor Input Circuit**: Handles input from motion sensors and darkness sensors.
2. **Power Circuit**: Manages the power supply for the system.
3. **Output Circuit**: Controls the lighting output based on user or automatic inputs.

## Enclosure Design

Enclosures are modelled from CAD software Solidworks 2020. The lid and box are the parts in the enclosure. There are relevant holes to assemble sensors to the enclosure and mounting bosses to mount the PCB.

## Future Improvements

1. **WiFi Connectivity**: Currently, the system offers remote control via a dedicated remote. In the future, we plan to integrate the ESP32 chip to enable WiFi connectivity. This enhancement will allow users to control the room lighting remotely via a mobile app or web interface. Additionally, it opens up possibilities for automation, scheduling, and integration with smart home ecosystems, making the system even more versatile and convenient.
